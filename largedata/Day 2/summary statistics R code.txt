#art count of articles produced during last 3 years of Ph.D.
#fem factor indicating gender of student, with levels Men and Women
#mar factor indicating marital status of student, with levels Single and Married

#phd prestige of Ph.D. department
#ment count of articles produced by Ph.D. mentor during last 3 years
